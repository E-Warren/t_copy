# What is Tappt? #
**FOR** visually impaired students in grades K-12 **WHO** struggle to participate in online class game activities, **THE** product “Tappt” is a gamified quizzing website with customized accessibility features for visually impaired students **THAT** can provide an immersive educational experience and allow educational games to be played by all students in class without sidelining students due to lack of accessibility features. **UNLIKE** existing quiz platforms like Kahoot! and GIMKIT **OUR PRODUCT** provides accessibility features for visually impaired students, such as text-to-speech for the whole classroom and a simplified control setup, where students utilize a computer’s keyboard to answer questions. After the game is over, the website also offers an overview of missed questions for studying purposes.

# Prepare for learning that EVERYONE will enjoy. #

### Did you hear that? 🗣️ ### 
For many blind and visually impaired (BVI) students, traditional quizzing games are inaccessible due to their fast-paced reading-based design, especially when prompts are displayed on a centralized classroom screen. In all Tappt games, question content is read aloud BEFORE the timer starts, so games can be played by BVI and non-BVI students alike. Plus, once the question timer starts, students can press “f” to selectively re-listen to the prompts on their own device, and all content is displayed on students’ personal devices to supplement the audio input. Sounds like an accessibility win!

### Earn Points & Stay Engaged 🎯 ### 
You didn’t think we were just sitting around to listen, did you? During question-reading periods, students can tap the trackpad or spacebar to earn points and climb the leaderboard. We believe that fun learning is the best learning, and accommodation-friendly classrooms should be no exception! This mechanism keeps things engaging for all students, whether they’re listening closely to the audio prompt or waiting for the next question’s text to pop up. More info on scoring below!

### No mouse? No problem. 💯 ### 
For some users, moving a mouse and clicking on a specific region can be a bit of a guessing game. Guess no more! When selecting an answer on Tappt, students can alternatively use the arrow keys (top, left, right, bottom) to select the button corresponding to their answer choice. This way, students can focus more on the content of the question and less on the coordinates of their mouse! 

# Create a deck & engage your class with just a few taps! #

###  A Little Healthy Motivation… 📚 ### 
Student click scores can be increased or multiplied using power-ups earned from correct answers. This way, everyone has a fair shot at being on the top, but especially if you’re willing to put in the work to study!

### Keep it Competitive ⚔️ ### 
At the end of each question round, the game host can see a leaderboard of the current top-scoring students. This is a great resource to share with the class, or you can continue past it for a more sneaky way to play! The top three students are displayed in triumph at the end of the game… who will be your Top Tapper?

### Keep Track 📈 ### 
Also at the end of each question round, the game host can see a quick visual representation of class responses. If your class isn’t understanding a certain concept, this is a great opportunity to quickly troubleshoot and course-correct, and then jump back into the game!

### Everyone’s a Winner 🏆 ### 
After all of the questions are done, all students receive a prize: their own personalized review! This recap of content celebrates student successes and emphasizes possible areas of improvement for more efficient studying. Who knew learning could be this fun?
